Equipping leaders to engage the 7 spheres of society

It is estimated that only 7-14% of Christians have a biblical worldview. We live in a time where people are asking deeper  questions of life and wanting to know the truth. But how do we define truth? How do we answer the questions of where we come from, why are we here and where are we going?

Surveys are showing that college young people are searching for answers and are not afraid to talk about religion. Is the church ready for this challenge? Can we adequately dialogue with the main issues of our day? What do we do with questions regarding the refugee crisis, gender issues, political and economic shiftings?

The School of Biblical Christian Worldview will help equip you to tackle the major questions of our day. You will learn how to analyze a worldview and determine its implications. Together, we will look at various forms of media and art such as books, music, articles, movies, paintings and advertising to discover the implied worldview and re-interpret through a biblical lens.

Students leave the school with a clearer understanding of the Biblical worldview applied to all sphere of society and tools to determine the ultimate consequences of any worldview/philosophy.

Last fall, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Loren Cunningham said that the greatest threat to the world is not radical terrorism but the subtle dangers of atheistic humanism. Let's be ready for this challenge! Come learn how to love God with all your heart and mind. Developing a solid biblical worldview will give you the confidence and tools to talk about any issue in the world today with wisdom and in love.
